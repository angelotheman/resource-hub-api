# DevOps Resource Hub API


## Project Overview
The DevOps Resource Hub API is a backend system designed to create a centralized platform for DevOps professionals to share, discover, and evaluate tools, scripts, and best practices. This project addresses the challenge of scattered DevOps resources by providing a community-driven, searchable database of valuable DevOps assets.
